        <h3>Career Objective</h3>
        <p3>A Career Objective or a Resume Objective is essentially a heading statement that describes your
            professional goals in two to three sentences. Employers looking to hire an employee for a position tend
            to seek candidates that are driven enough to understand what they want.

        <h3>Internship Completed</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Infosys</b></dt>
            <dd>A preliminary base internship where python basics were taught and a project was required. We learned a lot with tutorials and assignments given and a project was submitted as final certification for completion of internship.</dd>
            <dt><b>Microsoft</b></dt>
            <dd>I was on Microsoft for a Software Engineering Internship. Even as an intern my work felt meaningful and challenging. What I most enjoyed was being in control of my own time, specially considering that I was working remotley.</dd>
            <dt><b>CISCO</b></dt>
            <dd>Had a great learning opportunity. As I was a intern the work load was not intense but the manager made sure to give me small portions of work that would help me learn new things throughout my tenure.</dd>
            <dt><b>Oracle</b></dt>
            <dd>I found this internship at the end of my senior year of high school. I was tasked with going through some training that delved into microprocessors design and testing. Although I was there for a short while, colleagues were quick to help and share their talent and knowledge with me. I felt respected and honored to be there, frankly, and I would not hesitate to go back if I were hired.</dd>
